## Hafiz of Shiraz
### Lost Joseph will return to Canaan's Land Again
- do not despair

His grieving father's house will fill with flowers again
- do not despair

O sorrow-stricken heart, your fortunes will revive,
Order will come to your distracted mind again
- do not despair

And if the heavens turn against us for two days
They turn, and will not stay forever in one place
- do not despair

Sweet singing bird, survive until the spring, and then
You'll tread on grass again, deep in the flowers' shade
- do not despair

Don't give up hope, you have no knowledge of Fate's lore;
Behind the veil who knows what hidden turns still wait?
- do not despair

When, if you long to tread the pilgrims' desert trail
To Mecca's distant shrine, sharp thorns beset your path
- do not despair

For God, who solves all sorrows, knows the sorrows of
Our absence and desire, the guardian's scornful rage
- do not despair

O heart, if nothingness should wash away the world,
Since Noah guides your craft, when you encounter storms
- do not despair

And though the journey's filled with dangers, and its goal
Is all unknown, there is no road that has no end
- do not despair

O Hafez, in night's darkness, alone, in poverty, While the Qur'an remains to you, and murmured prayer
- do not despair



### The Sacred Dance for Life
I sometimes forget that
I was created for joy
My mind is too busy
My heart is too heavy
Heavy for me to remember
that I have been
called to dance
the sacred dance for life

I was created to smile
to love
to be lifted up
and lift others up
O sacred one
Untangle my feet
from all that ensnares
Free my soul
That we might
Dance
and that our dancing
might be contagious.

I wish I could show you,
when you are lonely or in darkness
the astonishing light of your own being.
