## On immigration, permanency, and long-term goals
Recently, after a long, arduous, and draining process, I've finally been able to get my Canadian PR.
For me, this is not the end goal, but a huge milestone towards achieving a goal that I've set for myself since I was 15. That goal was to get some sort of (bureaucratic) permanency, in other words, **get a passport from a country that lets me travel care-free** (or, well, with less care), **and lets me stay there freely**.

Having been born in India, and subsequently the first family in our tree to leave, move to Dubai, be sent off to Hogwarts (yes, I went to a posh boarding school in the UK), and then to study all the way in Canada, only one thing has stayed constant - my Indian passport. I don't mean to undermine it at all; but it has caused me a lot of troubles along the way. Not being able to go on trips with the gang because "I need a visa", as an example. 

Another being that I wasn't able stay in the UK, because at the time, job prospects for foreigners were particularly bad, and the rules were stringent: get a job within a month of graduating, or get out. For me, this would have meant going back to the motherland, because Dubai was no haven either; nobody there gets any permanent residency. So it was settled since then, I would leave my friends, the ecosystem I had established over the course of five years, to go to Canada, get my passport, and finally relieve myself of these shackles.

Fast-forward **7 years** (god damn), after a four-year degree, and coming up to three years of work experience: **we made it**. 

Before I continue I have to say, I do not mean to undermine this for anyone. I do not mean to sound ungrateful, but I know it will. Nonetheless, I've heard that this is a pretty universal experience, so, I'll say it: **I don't care.** I find it really hard to care about this milestone, and maybe this is just a byproduct of how I (sadly) treat most of my goals, but honestly, what has really changed for me? Lower tuition if I wanted to go back to school (honestly this is kinda neat), the list of crimes that would warrant me getting kicked out of the country is now smaller, and ultimately, I can stay here for as long as I want, doing nothing and/or anything.

This wasn't my goal though, right?  That was to get something to help me get **out** of here, not to help me stay. Is that why it doesn't feel satisfying? Is that why this feels like just another day? Because I'm not technically at that goal yet?

I started to unravel this in conversation with a great friend one day. She usually has a great way of navigating, probing, and inquiring about my otherwise chaotic and unorganized mind. We arrived towards this: maybe the problem isn't my situation, but instead, my framing. Why have I held this so firmly, that I will one day be living in multiple countries? That I will be a nomad, and this Canadian immigration is a means to that? Especially at the age of 15? What did I know at that age? Back then, I even thought that a career in finance was for me. 

>"What if, the true achievement is setting up a "home-base". One that I can venture out of when I feel comfortable. Be it for a week, a month, 6 months even, circumstances permitting?"

I know I'll never appreciate fully how lucky I've been to have lived in multiple countries before even growing my first moustache hair, but at the same time, I don't think I've thought much about what the negative impacts of this have been on my personality, life, and me. While of course, I'm grateful to have travelled young, I've lost a lot of friends. I struggle to "name my home", when asked. When people ask me, "where are you from?", I feel like I'm reciting the abstract of a novel.

In lieu of this then, is it not nice to finally have, "a home"? Somewhere that I can laze around, or grind and try to build my empire? (not gonna happen). Somewhere that, I've finally established friends, live in an apartment that I'm proud of (and is thankfully rent-controlled ðŸ’€), and feel comfortable in? 

What does this mean for long-term goal making? How can I set goals for ten, fifteen years down the line, if circumstances, environments, finances, my personality and being, may all change?

I think my takeaway from this has been that, while long-term goal setting is good, it shouldn't be rigid. How strong I was in my belief that this is a means to a life filled with travel and adventure, while I admire it, it was not practical, nor do I feel that it particularly lines up with my interests anymore, frankly.

Set goals, don't be let down if it doesn't work out. Be open to your goals changing, and recognize that it is only natural for them to.

There's probably a better way of wording that.

Also, despite having my PR, I find myself yet again at the mercy of Canadian Immigration. All my friends are off enjoying the sunny beaches and zesty tacos of Mexico, a trip I was meant to go on, but sadly couldn't, while I waited for this slow bureaucratic cog to turn and finally ship me my damned PR card. Its been a month.. maybe when I finally get it... then I'll feel free?
