# About Me
My name is `Shivam Garg`, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to put here.
I guess that's the beauty of it; that it could be literally anything.

I've been lucky enough to live in many different countries: [India, UAE, UK, and Canada], the latter of which has been my home-base for the last 7 years.

My passions include playing the guitar, going on walks and taking pretty pictures, and increasing the variety of music I listen to.
